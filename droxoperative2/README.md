## Installing mods
Place the .zip files (without extracting them) on the Assets folder inside the game's root folder.

Example: c:\steam\STEAMAPPS\common\Drox Operative 2\Assets

You can also reach the game's root folder by right-clicking the game on your Steam library and going on Manage -> Browse Local Files.


## Disabling mods
If you want to disable a mod temporarily, you can create a folder inside the Assets folder and move the files there. You can also move the files to the game root folder instead. Just placing it out of the Assets folder will automatically disable them, and you can reenable them later by moving them back to the Assets folder.


## Uninstalling mods
Just delete the file of the mod you want to uninstall.


## Tool: Save Folder Clean Up
- [Batch File (right-click it, and select save link as)](https://github.com/TrueDarkness/soldakmods/blob/main/droxoperative2/tool_darkness_savefoldercleanup.bat?raw=true)

A file to be placed and run on your save folder (%LocalAppData%\DroxOperative2\User\chars) to remove all sectors (.map and .wld files) and log files as well.

The game keeps all your won/lost/abandoned sectors for no reason, and deleting them in-game isn't really practical.
